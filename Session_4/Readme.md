# **4 - RNNs & LSTMs**

**Assignment:** 

1. Refer to online remove RNN and add LSTM to the model. 
2. Refer to this . 
   1. The questions this time are already mentioned in the file. Take as much time as you want (but less than 7 days), to solve the file. Once you are done, then write your solutions in the quiz. 
   2. Please note that the **Session 4 Assignment Solution** will time out after 15 minutes, as you just have to copy-paste your answers.
